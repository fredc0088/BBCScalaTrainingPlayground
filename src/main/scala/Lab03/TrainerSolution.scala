/**
  * 1. Define a simple Algebraic Sum Data Type to represent days of the week. Provide the methods tomorrow and nextBusinessDay for the type.
  * 2. Look at the Box[A] type defined in the slides. What changes, if any, are needed to make this type covariant in its element type? Make the same changes to the MyList[A] type.
  * 3. Using the fold method defined on the MyList[A] type, implement the method
  *               contains(el: A): Boolean
  * which returns true if the list contains the element supplied as the parameter, and false otherwise.
  * 4. Binary Tree is a type that can easily be defined using a recursive ADT. A Binary Tree is
  *   • A leaf node, which contains a value of some type
  *   • An internal node, which contains a left and a right node
  * Implement this type, and provide a fold method for it. Using the fold method, implement a length method, which returns the number of leaf nodes in the tree.
